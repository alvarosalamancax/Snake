Hi! I am choidavid4 and this is my first "real" game in Java! Hope you enjoy it!

You should compile every file in src using javac and run the class 'SnakeGame' to play. 

I am gonna leave a .jar compiled in java 11 in case you don't want to compile it yourself. Just double click it and it should work.

The game has a lot of stuff that is kinda annoying like the font or the fact that the window is small and unrezisable but as my first game I am pretty proud of it.

Happy crawling!
